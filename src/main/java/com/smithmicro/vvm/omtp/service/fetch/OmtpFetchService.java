/**
 * Service to download the OMTP voicemail bodies.
 * <p>
 * This service will be triggered by a call to {@link #startService(Intent)} which will have been
 * made by the BroadcastReceiver responsible for handling the fetch intents.
 * <p>
 * This class contains no logic, but just delegates to the {@link OmtpFetchController}.
 * <p>
 * This class extends the {@link IntentService}, which makes the following guaranatees:
 * <ul>
 * <li>requests are handled on a single worker thread</li>
 * <li>only one request will be processed at a time</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Unfortunately the {@link IntentService} does <b>not</b> guarantee that this will be the same
 * thread each time, and indeed if one intent is completed before another is sent, then the service
 * will be stopped and restarted, and a different thread will be used. That it guarantees sequential
 * execution of the {@link #onHandleIntent(Intent)} method is great, but that it doesn't guarantee
 * memory visibility between two different calls to {@link #onHandleIntent(Intent)} is annoying. In
 * practice I can see from the implementation that a MessageQueue is used, which contains enough
 * synchronization to guarantee visibility also, but it seems brave to rely on this.
 * <p>
 * I therefore make {@link #onHandleIntent(Intent)} synchronized, which will serve to guarantee
 * memory visibility between successive calls, and coincidentally provides thread safety.
