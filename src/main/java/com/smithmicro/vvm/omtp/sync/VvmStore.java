/**
 * Abstraction for communicating with a service that stores voicemail messages.

 * In practice represented by a local store (backed by the content provider) or a remote store (an
 * OMTP based voicemail source, for example).
 * <p>
 * All methods that accept a {@link Callback} may be, but are not required to be, asynchronous in
 * operation. They may invoke the supplied callback before returning if the result is already known,
 * or alternatively they may perform processing in the background and invoke the callback later when
 * the result subsequently becomes known. No guarantee is made about which thread a callback will be
 * invoked on.
 * <p>
 * You must supply a valid callback to all methods that request one, you cannot pass null. If you
 * are not interested in the result of the call, you can pass in
 * {@link com.smithmicro.vvm.omtp.callbacks.Callbacks#emptyCallback()}.
