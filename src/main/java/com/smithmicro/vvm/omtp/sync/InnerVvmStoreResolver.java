/**
 * Helper class for use by the VvmStoreResolverImpl.
 * <p>
 * One-shot class, constructed by the VvmStoreResolverImpl in response to the full resolve method,
 * and then thrown away afterwards. You should not use this class directly, and you should not
 * attempt to re-use an instance of this class. The VvmStoreResolverImpl class will construct an
 * instance of this class, call the {@link #resolve()} method, and then drop the instance.
 * <p>
 * This class needs to be thread-safe, because the callbacks involved are complex and may happen on
 * arbitrary threads.
 * <p>
 * This class is in one of the following conceptual 'states':
 * <ul>
 * <li>Constructed, but not yet started.</li>
 * <li>Started, waiting for at least one message store to return its results.</li>
 * <li>Resolving the results of both fetches into actions to be performed on both stores.</li>
 * <li>Waiting for the list of actions to be completed on at least one store.</li>
 * <li>Done.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The original callback passed in with this class is guaranteed to be invoked at most once. Success
 * will only be called after both fetches complete, the sync resolves, and the new actions are
 * successfully completed. In any other situation, onFailure will be called as soon as the failure
 * is detected.
